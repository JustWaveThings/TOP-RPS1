/*    back to basics.... pseudocode and break it down into discrete parts

objectives

    overall goal - have a functional, console based rock paper scissors game that has 5 rounds and declares a winner at the end 

    Things needed to meet overall goal:
        - variables initalized for computer and player score
        - check at the end of the round if there's a winner of the game.
        - increment score at the end of the round 
        - keep and display score after each round.
        - random computer selection from options
        - prompt for player to pick an option  
        - fix player input to meet strict equality (bonus) not let player  make an invalid selection so no round is forfeit.  --  like an if statement that if the input isn't rock, paper, or scissors, it doesn't accept it and makes them input again before processing the input into the game. 
        - logic that compares computer choice to player choice to decide winner of round
        - bonus: contextually appropriate statements that add some fun to the winning and losing each round. 


        psuedocode 

        init compScore 0
        init playerScore 0

        if playerScore === 5 or compScore === 5 
         then gameOver 
         else
         playRound

        playRound gets parameters  compChoice and playerChoice
            if playerChoice is rock  & compChoice is scissors or not paper
                player wins
                increment playerScore +1
                return console log  ( Player wins - you chose playerchoice and computer chose compchoice )
            else 
                player loses
                increment compScore +1
                return console log ( player loses - you chose playerChoice and computer chose compChoice.)

           repeat for playerChoice scissors and paper
           ...

           gameOver
               if compScore === 5 
                    you lost the game.  reload page to try your luck next time 
               else if playerScore === 5
                    you won the game. reload page to try to win again.
