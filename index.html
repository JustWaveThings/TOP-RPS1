// next step 
// write function that plays single round of RPS.
    // two parameters
    //     playerSelection - make it case insensitive

// I need to psuedocode this first to get the logic right.

// player can have R P or S.
// computer can have R P or S.

// win conditions
// R beats S
// P beats R
// S beats P

// tie conditions
// R=R, P=P, S=S

// I could use a switch statement for each player choice and then the 3 options for the computer. This is inelegant... thinking some more...
//  We first need to check for a tie before evaluating a winner. 

// psuedocode   -  if computerPlay === playerSelection, then prompt "Tie. Go again."

// if not equal then nested switch statements one for players choice ?
